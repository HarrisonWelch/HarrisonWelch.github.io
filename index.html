      <p class="story_update">Updated: 6/13/2018</p>
      <p class="story_desc">Short Description: The Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) on Smart Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is a National Science Foundation (NSF) and Department of Defense (DoD) funded research program at Auburn University. There are nine to twelve positions for the 8-week program. The undergraduate research assistants are initiated to research under the guidance of faculty from Computer Science. The research assistants collaborate with their advisers and are expected to contribute to unmanned flying. Major objectives are to promote interests in UAVs and develop the research skills of the students. Women, minorities, and students from "undergraduate" institutions are especially encouraged to apply.</p>
